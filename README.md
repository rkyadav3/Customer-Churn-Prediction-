# Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning models. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a company's service. The ability to predict which customers are likely to churn allows companies to take proactive steps to retain these customers.

## Features:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to identify trends and relationships between features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Modeling**: Applying machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Technologies Used:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code execution.

## How It Works:
1. **Dataset**: The dataset contains various features related to customer demographics, services used, and account information.
2. **Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned, and categorical variables are converted into numerical values.
3. **Machine Learning**: A classification model is built to predict whether a customer will churn.
4. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

## Future Enhancements:
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Improving model performance by tuning hyperparameters.
- **Deep Learning**: Implementing deep learning techniques for better prediction accuracy.
- **Automated Reports**: Generating automated reports on churn analysis for business stakeholders.
